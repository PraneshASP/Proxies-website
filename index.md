# yAcademy Proxies Research

Proxies are a powerful but often misunderstood component in smart contracts. This research effort compiled proxy knowledge with the goal of assisting with improving the correctness of proxy implementations and improving security audits involving proxies. By sharing knowledge to increase the probability of a secure upgrade process, we can improve the security of the entire ecosystem.

This website is a work in progress and proxy information evolves over time. Please submit any corrections to [this site's github repo](https://github.com/engn33r/Proxies-website/tree/main/pages).

This research effort was led by [engn33r](https://github.com/engn33r) and [devtooligan](https://github.com/devtooligan) of yAcademy.
